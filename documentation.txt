Django Setup:
We've set up a Django project and created an application within it called 'store'.
We've also configured the settings and URLs for both the project and the 'store' application.

Models:
We've defined several models in store/models.py that represent the data we're working with.
    These include Product, Category, Order, and OrderItem.
These models represent the structure of the data in our database.

Admin Interface:
We've registered these models with the Django admin interface, which allows us to easily
    create, read, update, and delete instances of these models.

Views:
We've created several views in store/views.py.
These views are functions that take a web request and return a web response.
We have views for
    product listing, category listing, adding items to the cart, viewing the cart, and checking out.

Templates:
For each view, we've created a corresponding HTML template in the store/templates/store directory.
These templates define how the data returned by the views should be displayed in the browser.
We also have a base_generic.html template that provides a common structure for all our other templates.

URL Configuration:
We've defined URL patterns for each of our views in store/urls.py.
These patterns determine which view function should be called for a given web request.

Forms:
We've defined two forms in store/forms.py: AddToCartForm and CheckoutForm.
These forms are used to gather input from the user,
    specifically when they are adding items to their cart and checking out.

User Profile:
We've created a profile view and template that displays information about the current user and their past orders.



What's left to do:

Implement and connect a database:
At the moment the website is using no data at all.
    We need to connect a database to the project and populate it with some data.

Improving the Cart Functionality:
Currently, our 'add to cart' functionality is quite simple.
    In a real e-commerce site, you would need to handle the case where the user adds the same product to their cart multiple times.

Associating Orders with Users:
Right now, our Order model has a user field, but we're not actually setting this field anywhere.
In a real e-commerce site, when a user checks out, you would create an Order instance and set its user field to the current user.

Order Confirmation:
After a user checks out, it would be good to show them an order confirmation page.

Security and Error Handling:
We've done some basic error checking, but a real e-commerce site would need robust error handling
and security measures to protect users' data and handle situations like invalid input or database errors.

User Interface and Styling:
Our user interface is currently very basic.
A real e-commerce site would likely have a much more attractive and user-friendly interface,
    with features like a navigation bar, product images, user reviews, and so on.

Testing: We've not yet written any tests for our code. Writing tests is a crucial part of developing a reliable, maintainable application.
